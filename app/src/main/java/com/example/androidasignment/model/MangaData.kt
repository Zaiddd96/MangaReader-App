            description = "In the heart of The Gwichon Village Mystery, the focus is a community where peculiar and unexplainable events begin to unravel over time. The village seems to possess a remote and enigmatic personality, with a past of concealed secrets and unsettling tales. For the individuals residing there, everyone bears traits imbued with shades of darkness that deepen the enigma. Mumyeong Heo, touched by a mystery himself, plays the role of an outsider delving into the truths within the village. As I read the story, I was intrigued by the eerie vibe and the subtle clues sprinkled throughout Gwichon Village Chapter 1-5. If you love slow-burn mysteries with rich cultural references and a constant sense of foreboding, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat.",

            description = "The Remarried Empress introduces the readers to a cunning Duke Ergi artfully manipulating a naive Rashta. Her insecurities instigate Rashta to adopt dirty means to grab the strings of high society. Meanwhile, Ergi tries to strike up an impression on Navier, leaving her more wary of the foreigners’ presence. Rashta stirs up trouble in the ball by imitating Navier and blaming the Empress. But Sovieshu surprises Navier when he speaks in support of her. Let’s see how The Remarried Empress Chapter 33-40 will unfold for Navier, Heinrey, Sovieshu, and Rashta. The Remarried Empress shows Navier learning about Rashta’s stabbing. Her ladies-in-waiting inform her that Viscount Landre, an ardent admirer of Duchess Tuania, attacked Rashta. Duke Ergi came rushing and pulled the offender off Rashta. The Empress inquires about her health, and the scene shifts to an unconscious Rashta, flanked by the Emperor and a doctor. Duke Ergi enters to see his friend and is mildly surprised when Sovieshu doesn’t object to his attendance in her chamber.",
